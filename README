This repository is a subtree merge of the quantcast/qfs.git/wiki directory. The
community is encouraged to update the QFS wiki as they wish. However, public
editing has been turned off on the github wiki itself. Instead, the wiki
documents are mirrored in the wiki directory of the QFS source code. This allows
for a few things:

- Wiki documentation is distributed along with the qfs source code
- The community can use pull requests to submit changes to the wiki
- The community can request updates to the wiki in the same pull request as code
  changes are made, keeping code and documentation in sync

In order to update the wiki on Github with the latest content within the
quantcast/qfs.git/wiki directory, simply run `make` in this directory.
